Notes:
=================================================================

1/4/2016:  Somebody did it better: https://github.com/jameschildress/pdx-ri-map
But it's offline apparently permanently?

Redo the webapp in NodeJS using this API for Portland at least: 
http://api.civicapps.org/#restaurant-inspections
(cache results in local Mongo?)
Add some websocket shit for realtime moving map?
Firebase or Parse maybe?
============================================

4/18/2012: switched from MongoHQ to MongoLab (not enough storage on HQ free plan, although I may switch to their 5/mo. plan)			
Use: heroku config | grep MONGOLAB_URI
to get connection info (see: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mongolab#database_connection_information)

Parse these:
	http://www.co.clackamas.or.us/foodinspection/ris.php
	http://www3.multco.us/MCHealthInspect/ListSearch.aspx
	http://washtech.co.washington.or.us/restaurantinspections/

google maps thing should have a tabbed popup like padmapper.com

docs for sparkline lib: http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/

TODO: 
search
ordering by score, name
link from address to map zoom
add portland neighborhoods?
Also maybe send out Twitter notices of new inspections?
GeoRSS for what?
Sparklines for inspection history?
type-ahead for search box
API to return results by bounding box

=================================================================

fixing to move this over to NodeJS and PostGIS
    in Node, iterate over existing Mongo coordinates and jack them into PG
        geolib?
